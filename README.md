### Task 8: CSS Preprocessing with Sass

**Objective:** Use a CSS preprocessor like Sass to organize the stylesheet, enhance reusability, and learn modern front-end development practices.

**Functionality:**

- Set up a project to compile Sass (`.scss`) into standard CSS.
- Used Sass **variables** to manage a consistent color scheme and font styles.
- Organized the code with **nesting** to make it more readable and maintainable.
- Created **partials** (`_variables.scss`, `_mixins.scss`) to logically separate the code.
- Used Sass **functions** like `darken()` for advanced color manipulation.
